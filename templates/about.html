    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
        Mustang Map provides a visualization of data provided by the Bureau of Land Management's <a href="https://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/whbprogram/herd_management/Data.html">Mustang Program</a>. The BLM provides this data in the form of pdf - sometimes scans of printed pdfs. Mustang Map's database is based on the provided data, but may have small errors due to potential pdf to text conversion issues. This site is intended for visualization of data and should not be considered 100% accurate.
